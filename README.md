# 1904 Labs - Hours with Experts Application Challenge Problems
Data Engineering Hours With Experts Coding Challenge(s)!

## Challenges
Congrats on taking on the challenge of applying to Hours with Experts! We're looking forward to 
reviewing your challenge problems. Do not worry if you are unable to answer certain aspects of a question. 
We're looking for perserverance, problem solving, and breadth of knowledge across multiple different skillsets - Git, Command Line, SQL and a programming language such as Java, Scala, Python, C# or JavaScript. 

Your task is to work through and complete as much of each challenge problem as possible and submit your repository to our team for review. Good luck!

### Challenge #1 - Github
1. Navigate to the github directory in this repository in an editor of your choice or the command line
2. Follow the steps on the README in that directory to complete this challenge

### Challenge #2 - Command Line
Make it as far as you possibly can in the [Command Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/). If you get stumped, look on various resources online but don't click the view solutions button on the command challenge. We don't expect you to make it through completely, we just want to see
how far you can make it. Have fun with it and learn a lot! 

#### To submit your work: 
Take a screenshot of the farthest you got without clicking the "view solutions" button on the site. Email nrafferty@1904labs.com a picture of your final progress. Here's an example:

### Challenge #3 - Secret Recipe Code Challenge

The challenge:

> Many years ago, the perfect cookie recipe was created and then lost... until now. An encrypted version was discovered
> and it is up to you to recover the recipe so that the perfect cookie can be created once again.

For the Hours with Experts class, we will be coding in Scala. For this challenge you can choose any language you like, we have created starter projects in Java, Scala, and Python that you can use to get started:

- [Java Project](java/README.md)
- [Scala Project](scala/README.md)
- [Python Project](python/README.md)

Follow the instructions in one of the README's above. 

Email nrafferty@1904labs.com a link to your github repo containing your solution.

## Things not to worry about
 * Validating command line arguments - you can just assume each program takes 1 argument which is always a valid number
