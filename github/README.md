# Github Practice
We'll be using Github a lot in this class, so you'll need to make sure you're up to speed on some important skills.

## ToDos
In order to complete this challenge, here are the steps you need to complete:
1. Clone this repository locally (we recommend cloning inside a directory that contains all your Hours with Experts work)
2. Create a new branch to make changes (use the naming convention <yourFirstAndLastName-addFunFacts>)
Ex) My branch would be named NickRafferty-addFunFacts
3. Open ./funfacts/funfacts.txt in an IDE of your choice (IntelliJ, VS Code,etc) or directly from the command line with an editor of your choice (VIM, Nano, etc)
4. Following the format you see in the example, add your name and a fun fact about yourself
5. Commit your changes locally
6. Others will be editing this same file and adding their names and fun fact. It's your responsiblity to merge those changes to your branch so that there are no merge conflicts when you make your pull request
7. Push your changes up to Github
8. Create a PR for your changes
9. Our team will give you an approval to merge your changes or a comment if it is not ready to be merged
10. Once your name and fun fact are added and merged to main you've completed this challenge!
