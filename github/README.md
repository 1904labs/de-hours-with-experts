# Github Practice
We'll be using Github a lot in this class, so you'll need to make sure you're up to speed on some important skills.

## ToDos
In order to complete this challenge, here are the steps you need to complete:
1. Clone this repository locally (we recommend cloning inside a directory that contains all your Hours with Experts work)
2. Create a new branch to make changes (use the naming convention - yourFirstAndLastName-addFunFacts)
Ex) My branch would be named NickRafferty-addFunFacts
3. In the /github/funfacts/Spring2022 directory, create a directory with your name - ex) nickrafferty
4. In your directory, create a text file following this naming convention - funfacts.txt - ex) funfacts.txt
5. Following the format you see in the example in ./funfacts/Spring2022/funfacts.txt, add your name and a fun fact about yourself
6. Commit your changes locally
7. Push your changes up to Github
8. Create a PR for your changes
9. Once you create a PR, copy the link to your PR and add it to the Google Form that you were sent when given the application


## Tips:
