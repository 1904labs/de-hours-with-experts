Nicole Bausch - I've lived in Germany, Czechia, and Austria. I lived the longest in Austria (10 years) and worked mainly
as an ESL teacher and volunteer German tutor for refugees and children with migration backgrounds whose first language wasn't German.
But I also worked many odd jobs between teaching assignments, including bartending at metal clubs, entry and admission at night clubs,
modeling, and other hostess roles for promotional events.
