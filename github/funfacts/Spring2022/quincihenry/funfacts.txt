Quinci Henry - I grew up playing (and otherwise obsessing over) baseball, and I was fortunate enough to play at the Junior College level. Baseball stats are what piqued my interest in math, long ago, and in data, more recently. Since the end of my baseball career, I've gotten into the swing of golf!
