Nick Rafferty - I once worked as a cider brewer and bouncer at a brewery in Southern England. Hot tip - if you need a quality bouncer for any reason, I'm not your guy :)
Will Brinkman - Last weekend I rode 60 miles on my bike in a thunderstorm because I forgot to check the weather.  Hot tip - if you need a quality travel planner for any reason, I should not be that guy.
