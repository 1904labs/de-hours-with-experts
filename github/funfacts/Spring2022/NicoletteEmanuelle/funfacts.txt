Nicolette Emanuelle-I used to work as a barista at a Starbucks nextdoor to a hotel that would often house movie stars who 
were in town filming, because of this I know: Phillip Seymor Hoffman was laid back and would sit in the cafe with the coffee  
shop patrons to study his script, Arnold Schwarzenegger is shorter than he looks on TV and Michael Keaton takes two honey   
packets in his latte.
