Kara Gruenewald - In my life before I learned how to code, I worked in video production.  For almost 5 years I worked for a YouTube channel and not only worked as their video producer, but I also appeared in the videos. Having kids come up to you in public asking if you are Kara from a youtube channel is quite a unique experience!
