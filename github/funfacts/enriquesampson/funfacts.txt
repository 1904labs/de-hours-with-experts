Enrique Sampson - I'm obsessed with cooking, I think it's one of the most accessible art forms. I like to cook things that are nostalgic to my family since they're not in Missouri. Specifically, one my favorite dishes to make is Kimchi Fried Rice, but my twist is to integrate italian ingredients and treat it somewhat like Carbonara. --I could go on forever but will keep it short haha.
